# hello-world
My name is Cameron Chardukian. While I was born in the USA, I've spent the last several years living abroad with most of that time having been spent in Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia. While living abroad I've done several things as to utilize my time productively. Some of which include:

-- Gaining experience working remotely as an SEO and content marketing consultant.

-- Learning Vietnamese

-- Completing my Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Thomas Edison State University

-- Teaching myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript (as of April 2019)

In the coming months I intend to gain more experience with front-end frameworks, particularly React. I'd also like to demonstrate my enthusiasm for becoming a better developer by learning GIT and GitHub and regularly pushing and updating my repositories.

Doing so will not demonstrate that I'm coding and trying to become a better developer almost everyday. It will also help prepare me for collaborating with others when I land my first job working as a developer.

Given my past efforts (450+ hours already invested into coding), plus my aggresive learning schedule for this summer, I intend to be working full-time as a web developer by October or so.
